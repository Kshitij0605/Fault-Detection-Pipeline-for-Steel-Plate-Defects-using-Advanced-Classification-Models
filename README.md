# Skin Cancer Classification

## Overview
This project aims to classify skin cancer using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of skin lesion images and predicts the type of skin cancer based on image analysis.

## Features
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN-based deep learning model
- Multi-class classification of skin cancer types
- Model evaluation using various metrics
- Deployment-ready architecture

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of different types of skin cancer, along with corresponding labels. Ensure that the dataset is properly structured before training the model.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Kshitij0605/Skin-Cancer-Classification.git
   cd Skin-Cancer-Classification
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure that you have the necessary dataset placed in the appropriate directory.

## Usage
1. Train the model:
   ```sh
   python train.py
   ```
2. Evaluate the model:
   ```sh
   python evaluate.py
   ```
3. Make predictions:
   ```sh
   python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   ```

## Model Architecture
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Batch normalization and dropout layers to improve generalization
- Softmax activation for multi-class classification

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results
The model achieves a high classification accuracy on the test dataset. Further improvements can be made through hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation.
